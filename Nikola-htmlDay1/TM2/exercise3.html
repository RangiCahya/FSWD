    <h1>Eye of the Tiger</h1>
<p>Rising up, back on the street <br>
    Did my time, took my chances <br>
    Went the distance,now I'm back on my feet <br>
    Just a man and his will to survive</p>
<p>So many times it happens too fast <br>
    You change your passion for glory <br>
    Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past <br>
    You must fight just to keep them alive</p>
<p>It's the eye of the tiger <br>
    It's the thrill of the fight <br>
    Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
    And the last known survivor <br>
    Stalks his prey in the night <br>
    And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
<p>Face to face, out in the heat <br>
    Hanging tough, staying hungry <br>
    They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <br>
    For the kill with the skill to survive</p>
<p>It's the eye of the tiger <br>
    It's the thrill of the fight <br>
    Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
    And the last known survivor <br>
    Stalks his prey in the night <br>
    And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
<p>Rising up straight to the top <br>
    Had the guts, got the glory <br>
    Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop <br>
    Just a man and his will to survive</p>
<p>It's the eye of the tiger <br>
    It's the thrill of the fight <br>
    Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
    And the last known survivor <br>
    Stalks his prey in the night <br>
    And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger <br>
    The eye of the tiger <br>
    The eye of the tiger <br>
    The eye of the tiger <br>
    The eye of the tiger</p>
