    <p id="movie"><strong>Gladiator</strong> is a 2000 epic historical drama film directed by <i> Ridley Scott</i> and written by David
        Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. The film was co-produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and
        Universal Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures distributed the film in North America while Universal Pictures released
        it internationally through United International Pictures. It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
        Nielsen, Ralf MÃ¶ller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard
        Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when
        Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to
        slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his
        family and his emperor. <br><br>
        Inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book Those About to Die (formerly titled The Way of the Gladiator), the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography, which began in January 1999 and wrapped up in May of that year, was known to have a set of problems due to the script being unfinished, with several of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen week shoot in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. The film's computer-generated imagery effects were created by British post-production company The Mill, who also created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character Proximo due to Reed dying of a heart attack during production. <br><br>

Gladiator was anticipated to become one of 2000's most successful films. Upon its release, the film grossed over $460.5 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000, finishing behind Mission: Impossible 2. The film received generally positive reviews from critics with praise for the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances), Scott's direction, visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values.The film won multiple awards, including five at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Crowe, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It also received four BAFTA Awards at the 54th British Academy Film Awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Editing. Gladiator helped launched or revitalized the careers of several cast and crew members, particularly elevating Crowe to leading man status and helping Phoenix breakout into the <br><br>

Since its release, Gladiator has been critically reevaluated and it has been considered to be one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best action films of the 21st Century. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and other time periods throughout world history. Several films has attempted to emulate Gladiator's visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of democracy, fascism, the power of the people, masculinity, and stoicism. In 2021, Scott officially announced that writing had begun on a sequel to the film, which would formally enter development after the completion of his Napoleon biopic.[6] <br><br>
