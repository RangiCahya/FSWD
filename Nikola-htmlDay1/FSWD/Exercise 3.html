    <h1>Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb</h1>
    
    <i><p>Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)<br>
        Is there anybody in there?<br>
        Just nod if you can hear me<br>
        Is there anyone home?<br>
        Come on now<br>
        I hear you're feeling down<br>
        Well I can ease your pain<br>
        Get you on your feet</p>
        
        <div>
        I'll need some information first<br>
        Just the basic facts<br>
        Can you show me where it hurts?</div>

        <p>There is no pain you are receding<br>
        A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
        You are only coming through in waves<br>
        Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
        When I was a child I had a fever<br>
        My hands felt just like two balloons<br>
        Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
        I can't explain you would not understand<br>
        This is not how I am<br>
        I have become comfortably numb<br>
        I have become comfortably numb</p></i>
