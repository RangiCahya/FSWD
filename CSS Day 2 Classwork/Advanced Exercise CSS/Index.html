      E Corp, is one of the largest multi-national conglomerates in the world.
      Among their enterprises, they manufacture computers, phones, and tablets,
      and maintain a banking and consumer credit division. According to Mr.
      Robot, the company owns 70% of the global consumer credit industry, which
      is why fsociety has targeted them, and why Mr. Robot recruited Elliot to
      help them hack into their network. Fsociety is responsible for a DDoS
      attack that lead to the dismissal and potential criminal prosecution of
      Terry Colby, E Corp's former Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Tyrell
      Wellick believes the CTO position should now be his, but he was passed
      over in favor of outsider Scott Knowles, who he then attempts to bring
      down.
